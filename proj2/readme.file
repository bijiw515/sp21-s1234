# Gitlet

Gitlet is a simplified version-control system that mimics some core features of Git. It was implemented in Java for educational purposes, based on the [CS61B Data Structures course at UC Berkeley](https://sp21.datastructur.es/).

## 📦 Features

- Initialize a Gitlet repository (`init`)
- Add and remove files from the staging area (`add`, `rm`)
- Commit changes with a message (`commit`)
- View commit history (`log`, `global-log`)
- View status of the working directory (`status`)
- Checkout files and branches (`checkout`)
- Create and switch branches (`branch`, `checkout [branch]`)
- Remove branches (`rm-branch`)
- Reset to previous commits (`reset`)
- Merge branches (`merge`)

## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Git (optional, for managing this repo)

### Compilation

Compile all Java files in the `gitlet` directory:

```bash
javac gitlet/*.java
